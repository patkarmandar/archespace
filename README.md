Arche Space is an open source, private, encrypted space for organizing ideas, plans, notes, checklists, and cards. It is built as a self-hostable web app with Supabase sync and a client-side encrypted vault, ensuring that your saved content stays private even from the application owner and developers.

It follows a zero-knowledge architecture: your content is encrypted in the browser and the backend only ever stores ciphertext, so the server, its operators, and the developers never see your data in readable form.

## Security model

Arche Space uses a browser-side vault model. You sign in with Supabase Auth using a login password, then unlock a separate vault PIN or passphrase to access encrypted data - the password proves account ownership, the PIN or passphrase protects the content itself.

**Encryption**

- Space and item content (names, descriptions, tags, titles, and content) is encrypted client-side with AES-GCM before it reaches Supabase. Only non-sensitive metadata - IDs, timestamps, positions, and flags like pinned/archived/deleted - stays in plain form.
- The vault secret is never stored as plaintext. It can be a numeric PIN or a longer passphrase (letters, numbers, or symbols), so you can trade convenience for strength. On setup, the browser generates a random vault master key, which is wrapped with a key derived from your PIN or passphrase using Argon2id, a memory-hard key-derivation function that resists offline brute-forcing. Vaults created before Argon2id support was added continue to use PBKDF2 and are upgraded to Argon2id automatically the next time the PIN or passphrase is changed.
- Because encryption happens client-side, stored content is not readable by developers or app owners from the database.

**Sessions and access**

- The unlocked vault key is held as a non-extractable key in IndexedDB - usable for decryption within the tab but not readable or exportable by scripts - and auto-locks after 24 hours.
- The login session has an absolute lifetime of 1 week.
- Password reset and password change flows globally sign out existing sessions.
- Failed login attempts and failed vault PIN attempts are rate limited, and repeated PIN failures lock the vault server-side.
- Supabase Row Level Security restricts each user to their own rows.

**Recovery**

- A one-time recovery code is generated during initial vault setup and shown once in the app - it is not emailed, so it must be saved when shown.
- The recovery code can be recreated from Settings by entering the current vault PIN.
- If the PIN is forgotten, the "Forgot PIN" flow uses the recovery code to set a new vault PIN.
- Resetting with a recovery code generates a new recovery code and invalidates the previous one.

**Account deletion**

- Deleting an account permanently removes the user and, by cascade, all of their spaces, items, and encrypted vault data.
- A confirmation email is sent automatically after deletion, server-side, using the Resend HTTP API. The Resend API key is stored encrypted in Supabase Vault and never reaches the browser.

**Limits to be aware of**

- The app cannot recover encrypted content without either the current vault PIN or the current recovery code - there's no backdoor.
- If both the vault PIN and recovery code are lost, encrypted space data cannot be decrypted.
- JSON exports are downloaded to your machine and should be stored carefully; imported backups are encrypted before upload.
- Client-side encryption is only as safe as the code your browser runs - a tampered build or malicious dependency could bypass it. Self-hosting, HTTPS, and reviewed dependencies reduce this, and Settings shows the exact build commit (linked to GitHub) so you can verify the running code.

## Audit logging

Arche Space keeps an owner-only `audit_log` table for authentication and security events. It is deliberately scoped:

- **Auth events only.** Space and item content is never written to the audit log.
- **Owner-only access.** Row Level Security has no policies and table grants are revoked, so end users cannot read or write it directly. Writes come only from `SECURITY DEFINER` triggers and a whitelisted RPC. The app owner reads it from the Supabase dashboard or with the service role.
- **Survives deletion.** The `user_id` foreign key is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so history is retained after an account is removed.

Recorded actions include: `account_created`, `account_deleted`, `email_change`, `password_reset_requested` (server-side, via triggers on `auth.users`), and `login`, `logout`, `password_change`, `password_reset`, `vault_setup`, `vault_unlock`, `vault_lock`, `vault_pin_change`, `vault_pin_reset`, `recovery_code_created`, `export`, `import` (client-side, via the `log_client_event` RPC).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patkarmandar/archespace
cd archespace
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create and configure a Supabase project

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Run the full `schema.sql` file in the Supabase SQL Editor.
3. Enable the Email provider in Supabase Auth.
4. Configure Resend as the SMTP server in Supabase Auth for password reset and auth emails.
5. Paste the branded email templates from `email-templates/` into Supabase Auth (see [Email templates](#email-templates)).
6. Add your deployed app URL to Supabase Auth redirect URLs.
7. Add `https://your-domain/reset-password` to Supabase Auth redirect URLs for password reset links.
8. Keep Supabase Auth sign-in rate limits at `30/hour per IP` or lower for production.

### 4. Enable the account-deletion email

The deletion confirmation email is sent from a Postgres trigger using the Resend HTTP API, with the key stored in Supabase Vault:

1. Enable the `pg_net` extension (the statement is included in `schema.sql`, or enable it under Database → Extensions).
2. Store your Resend API key in Vault (run once in the SQL Editor; do not commit the key):

   ```sql
   select vault.create_secret('re_your_real_key', 'RESEND_API_KEY');
   ```

3. In `schema.sql`, set the `v_from` and `v_support` addresses in `notify_account_deleted()` to a domain you have verified in Resend.

### 5. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 6. Choose single-user or multi-user mode

**Single-user mode** is the default - create one user in the Supabase Auth dashboard and keep public sign-up disabled.

**Multi-user mode** is optional. To enable it:

```env
VITE_ALLOW_SIGNUP=true
```

or:

```env
VITE_MULTI_USER=true
```

Also enable Supabase Auth email sign-ups, tighten sign-up and password-reset rate limits, and verify RLS policies before public deployment.

### 7. Run the app

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally (Wrangler)
npm run preview
```

Production is deployed by Cloudflare's Git-connected builds: pushing to `main` triggers a build (`npm ci && npm run build`) and deploy automatically, so there is no manual deploy step.

## Email templates

Branded, minimal HTML templates for every Supabase auth email live in `email-templates/`. Paste each into **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates**; the folder's `README.md` maps each file to its template slot, the `{{ .Variable }}` tokens it uses, and a suggested subject line.

| File | Supabase template |
|------|-------------------|
| `confirm-signup.html` | Confirm signup |
| `invite-user.html` | Invite user |
| `magic-link.html` | Magic Link |
| `change-email.html` | Change Email Address |
| `reset-password.html` | Reset Password |
| `reauthentication.html` | Reauthentication |
| `password-changed.html` | Password Changed |
| `email-changed.html` | Email Changed |

The account-deletion email is separate; its HTML lives inside `notify_account_deleted()` in `schema.sql` because Supabase Auth does not send it.

## Deployment notes

- On Cloudflare, connect the repository so pushes to `main` build and deploy automatically (Git-connected builds run `npm ci && npm run build`). For any other host, run `npm run build` and deploy the `dist/` directory.
- Configure SPA fallback to `index.html`. `dist/404.html` is generated during build for hosts that need an SPA fallback file.
- Configure Supabase redirect URLs for `/login` and `/reset-password`.
- Configure Resend SMTP in Supabase Auth before relying on password reset and other auth emails.
- Enable `pg_net` and store `RESEND_API_KEY` in Supabase Vault before relying on the account-deletion email.
- Rebuild after changing environment variables.
- Hard refresh after deploying PWA changes if a browser keeps an old service worker cache.
